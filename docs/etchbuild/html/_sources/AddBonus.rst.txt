Add Bonus
=========

Etch works by defining a bonus condition which identified by its name. Hence bonus names must be unique. We recommend that a bonus name is descriptive such 
as Christmas2019.

Once a bonus is defined, then the precise conditions can be defined. This are the actual conditions which must be met. 

The following fields should be completed on the Add Bonus screen. They are needed for the bonus condition to be described.

* Bonus Type (Team, Individual, Company)
* Bonus Name (unique and descriptive)
* Bonus Date (this is expiry date of the Bonus Condition)
* Target (the measurement which should be reached, eg hours worked)
* Condition (greater then, or less than)
* Bonus Payable (what is paid)
* Token (currency of the payment)
